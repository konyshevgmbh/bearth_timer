Builds CO₂ tolerance through cyclical holds without rest.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:\\n1. Inhale for 5 seconds through pursed lips\\n2. Hold breath on full inhale (main phase)\\n3. Exhale for 5-10 seconds with resistance\\n4. Hold on empty lungs (optional for beginners)\\n\\nKEY PRINCIPLE:\\nNo rest between cycles. This accumulates CO₂ and helps the body adapt to higher carbon dioxide levels.\\n\\nPROGRESSION:\\nStart: 2 minutes with 30-second cycles (4 cycles)\\nAdvance: Gradually increase to 15 minutes total\\nCycles: 30s → 35s → 40s → 45s → 50s...\\nFocus: Extend mainly the hold after inhale. Start with cycle count\\n\\nSAFETY:\\nAlways sit or lie down. Never practice in water as a beginner. Take rest days when needed.\\n\\nLearn more: Search \\\"Molchanov breath hold training\\\"",
