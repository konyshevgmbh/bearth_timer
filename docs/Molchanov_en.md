## Exercise for Developing Breath-Holding on Land

Hello, friends! Today I want to tell you about an exercise you can do on land to improve your breath-hold. Many of you asked about it in the comments under my previous video, so feel free to write what else interests you—about freediving, running, breathing—and I’ll be happy to share! I write down all your comments in my list and prepare new content for you.

### Exercise Description

This exercise is very compact and short—it takes from 5 to 15 minutes and can be done daily. You can do it as a light, gymnastic routine, or increase the breath-hold times as you progress. I personally do it even during flights when I can’t access a pool. Even after long flights, this exercise helped me perform well at competitions.

The exercise consists of cycles of breath-holding without rest between them. Each cycle includes four phases:
1. Inhale
2. Breath-hold after inhalation
3. Exhale
4. Breath-hold after exhalation

If the breath-hold after exhalation feels too difficult, you can start with the first three phases.

### How to Perform

1. **Inhale**: Slowly, through pursed lips (like through a straw), for about 5 seconds. At the end of the inhale, relax your shoulders and make sure your whole body is relaxed.
2. **Hold your breath after inhaling**: The duration depends on your cycle. For example, if your cycle is 30 seconds, do a 5-second inhale, a 15-second breath-hold, and a 10-second exhale.
3. **Exhale**: Also slowly, with resistance through your lips, for 5–10 seconds. At the end, relax your muscles, especially your abdomen.
4. **Hold your breath after exhaling**: In the early stages, you can skip this if it's too hard.

Perform the cycles one after another, without any rest in between. This helps your body get used to higher levels of CO₂, making it easier to hold your breath. This exercise also improves the elasticity of your breathing muscles.

### Progression

Start with 5 minutes of exercises with 30-second cycles. Gradually increase the duration: 6 minutes, 7 minutes, and so on, up to 15 minutes. Slowly increase the length of each cycle: first 30 seconds, then 35, 40, 45, 50 seconds, and so on. If it gets too hard, take a day off or slightly reduce the cycle length.

Most progress will come from increasing the breath-hold after inhaling. Only start increasing the hold after exhaling once you can comfortably manage one-minute cycles.

### Examples

**Example 1 (30-second cycle):**
- Inhale — 5 seconds
- Hold after inhale — 15 seconds
- Exhale — 10 seconds

**Example 2 (1-minute cycle):**
- Inhale — 5 seconds
- Hold after inhale — 40 seconds
- Exhale — 15 seconds

In both versions, the main focus is on relaxation, getting used to full lungs, and controlling your neck and facial muscles.

### Recommendations

- It’s best to do this exercise sitting or lying down, to ensure maximum comfort and safety.
- It’s convenient to track time with a stopwatch or with special apps.
- Do **not** do this exercise in water if you are a beginner! Only on land, and always with proper supervision.
- If you are an experienced freediver or spearfisher, you can include this exercise in your regular training routine.

Let me know in the comments how long you were able to hold your breath, what cycle you started with, and what topics you’d like me to cover next! Thank you for your attention and see you in the next episodes!
